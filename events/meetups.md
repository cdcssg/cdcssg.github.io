1. Find a suitable venue with plenty of space for the children, and a kitchen so you can provide tea and coffee. Look for local play centres, or special needs clubs.

2. Pick a date and time that suits you and maybe a few others. You'll never find a date that everyone can make, so it's best to choose one and get on with it.

3. Always assume that 10-20% of people will drop out; it always happens!

4. Organise catering. You can do this in the same venue, or you can find a nearby pub or restaurant. Buffets work well, but remember that kids don't eat much (especially when excited), and allow for the dropout rate!

5. [Get in touch with us](mailto:office@criduchat.org.uk?subject=Regional Meetup) and let us know what you're planning before you commit to anything. You can claim up to Â£500 from the support group, but we'd like to know where it's going first! [You can download the terms and conditions for the grant here](/downloads/get_together_application.pdf).

6. Promote the meetup by [creating a Facebook event on the CDCSSGUK group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/cdcssguk/events/), and let us know so we can put it on the website and newsletter.

7. Create a document with all the details and email it to your attendees a week before the event, and link to it from your facebook event.  Remember to include times, directions, venue details, parking options and changing facilities.  

8. Enjoy the event and take lots of photos! Remember to ask permission from parents to put the photos online afterwards.

9. Get receipts for everything, and then claim back the money from the support group by filling in the [claim form](/downloads/get_together_application.pdf) and sending it in.

10. Write a short article about the meet-up for the website and newsletter. We love to hear about what you've been doing!
