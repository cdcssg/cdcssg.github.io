The Support Group has set aside an amount of money each year for small grants:

**Equipment Fund Grant**: Up to the value of £150, for families to purchase equipment.

**Regional Get Together Grant**: From £50 to £500, for families to organise activities in their area which benefit CdCS families.

Funding for both of these will be allocated on a case by case basis, and will be considered by members of the Support group's management committee.

Decisions will normally be made within three weeks after the application has been received.

Full details can be found in the following terms of reference / application forms, or can be requested from [office@criduchat.org.uk](mailto:office@criduchat.org.uk).
