<p>
  Much of the support group's face-to-face contact happens at our family weekends, 
  but we also support local meetups through the rest of the year. If you would like
  to organise one, visit our <a href='/events/index.html'>events</a> page for
  details.

<h2>Facebook</h2>

<p>
  The easiest way to connect with other families is on Facebook.
</p>

<p>
  Most conversation happens on our own discussion group.
  It's very friendly, and people are always willing to help out with support or 
  advice.
