## Annual Family Weekend

Every year, we organise a weekend where families can get together and share their
experiences. See our main [family weekend](/family-weekends/index.html) pages for 
all the details.

## Local meetups

We are happy to provide support to people wanting to organise local meetups. If you
would like to organise an event in your area, please visit the [funding & grants page](/community/grants.html) to find out more.
