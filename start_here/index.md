If you're here because your child has been diagnosed with Cri du Chat Syndrome, then
we're here for you. We know this is a really tough time, but you <em>will</em> get through it, and
although life will be different from what you expected, it'll be OK.

## What is this thing?

Most likely, you've been told a load of medical jargon so far. 

To keep it simple, Cri du Chat Syndrome is caused by a bit missing from one of your 
child's chromosomes, and it's pretty rare; around 1 child in 50,000. Most of the time
it's just random - there's no reason behind it, no root cause.

## How will it affect my child?

There is a huge variation in how it affects children, depending on how much genetic 
material is missing, but all will be slower to learn new things and develop physically.
Most obviously, this means that they won't walk or talk at the same time as other 
children. 

It's important to remember, though, that they <em>do</em> learn, and <em>do</em> develop,
just not at the same speed as others.
