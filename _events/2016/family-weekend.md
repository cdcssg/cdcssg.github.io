# Workshops & Talks

## Keynote Talk: Forever Savvy

*Angie Stokes and Amanda Phelps*

There are lots of ‘babysitting’ services out there for adults with special needs, but as parents we both think that our adults should be spending their time constructively, gaining skills and not just being occupied. 

[Forever Savvy](http://www.foreversavvy.co.uk/) allows trainees to learn new skills which are transferable to voluntary or paid employment. They gain the ethics of working and doing what needs to be done not just what they want to do, they learn about timekeeping and doing a job to a required standard. To all intents and purposes they are going to work when they come to Forever Savvy. 

When they are ready (and for some that may be years away), we look for suitable placements for them in the area which they would like, and are capable of working in. Forever Savvy then acts as the agent between the company and the trainee and supports them in their work placement for as long as is needed, ironing out any problems before it becomes too big that the relationship breaks down. 

Forever Savvy is funded by the trainees personal budget whilst on the farms or in work placement. It is a positive risk environment, meaning that not much is a no-no and supervision is given at all times.

## Workshop: Makaton

*Helene Elia*

What is [Makaton](http://makaton.com)? How and when can you use it? This session will teach about 20 basic signs and symbols to help communication with your children, as well as offer space for general signing questions and discussion. The workshop will run multiple times through the day, so if you cannot make one, there should be another opportunity. Helene will also be available throughout the day to talk with parents and offer ideas and suggestions to help them move forward with their child’s or young person’s speech, language and communication needs.

Helene is a Specialist Speech and Language Therapist (SLT) currently working for Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust.  She works with children from birth until they leave full-time education and specialise with children who are deaf or have hearing impairments.  She also works in community clinics as well as with preschool children with special needs.  She is a licensed Makaton Regional Tutor and has been teaching and using Makaton in her work since 1989. She used to work with adults with a range of learning disabilities and adult neurological difficulties and stammerers.  She teaches Makaton and communication strategies to professionals and to parents and carers of children and adults who need to develop their communication, speech and language skills.  

## Workshop: Sleep

*Helen Rutherford* 

Discuss your children's sleep issues, and techniques to help them. Facilitated by Helen Rutherford from the [Children’s Sleep Charity](http://www.thechildrenssleepcharity.org.uk/).

## Workshop: Scoliosis

*Caspar Hull*

Scoliosis (curvature of the spine) is a common problem in children with Cri du Chat. Discuss any concerns, experiences, or questions in this group, facilitated by Caspar Hull, osteopath and CdCSSG committee member.

## Workshop: Challenging Behaviour

*Pippa McIntyre*

Many of our children have some challenging behaviour. This workshop is to share your experiences, explore techniques and tools to manage behaviour, and learn how to create a positive behaviour support plan for your child.

## Workshop: Puberty

*Caspar Hull*

Puberty can be a confusing time for anyone! Discuss how to help your child navigate it with other parents, and share experiences. Led by Caspar Hull, who’s been through it all himself (so to speak).

## Workshop: Direct Payments

*Angie Stokes*

Direct payments are a way for you to take control of the care your child needs. Find out more about what they are, how they work, and share your experiences of using them best. Facilitated by Angie Stokes and Amanda from [Forever Savvy](http://www.foreversavvy.co.uk/).

## Workshop: Support Group

*James Smith & Lucy Santos*

A discussion session for those who wish to know more about the support group – whether it be how you can get involved with fundraising, or how you can access grants to arrange regional family meetings. We are also interested in hearing how we can help you more. All ideas and comments are welcome! 

We’re also looking for committee members, so come along if you want to help out on that front.

## And there’s more!

There are more workshops still being finalised around respite, toilet training, and more, which will be added to this list when final!

# Frequently Asked Questions

### How many can sleep in each room?

Each room can take two adults, and two children under 12 on z-beds. We also have a few larger rooms available that will fit a cot as well if you are a family with three small children.

### Are cots provided by the hotel?

The hotel will be able to provide some cots, but supply is always limited, so if you have a travel cot you can bring, please do.
