Every year the week around 5th May (5/5) is Cri du Chat Syndrome awareness week.

## Why the number 5?

Cri du Chat Syndrome is a deletion on the short (p) arm of the 5th Chromosome; it's otherwise known as 5p-.

## Raising Awareness

There are loads of ways that you can let people know about CdC.

* Post a CdC image to your social media profile (see below);
* Chat to 3 people about CdC and give them an information sheet. Download and edit this [example information sheet](/downloads/cdc_info_sheet.doc) with your own story;
* Purchase and display a CdC sticker on your car;
* Ask a local shop, businesses, coffee shop or pub to have a [CdC wine bottle](/fundraising/5p-for-5p.html) to collect 5 pence pieces;
* Host a [Coffee morning](/downloads/coffee_morning_invitation.doc) at your home. Ask family & friends to bake cakes; invite neighbours and friends or parents from the school gate. Have a donations box by the cakes;
* Tell us about your familiesâ€™ journey with CdC. Maybe we could include it in one of our newsletters or website.

## Social Media
