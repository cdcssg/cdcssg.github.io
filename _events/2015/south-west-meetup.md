A chance for people to meet other CDC families, you don't have to live in the South West... everyone is welcome.

I've hired a hall and soft play/toys and have arranged for a lady who does a class at a local special needs school to come and do an hour of entertainment including dancing, story books and balloons on parachute, it's suitable for all ages and abilities. Then we'll have some food and a chance to chat!
