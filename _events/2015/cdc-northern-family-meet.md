Northern Meet up for families. A chance to catch up with old friends and meet new ones. 

We will be having a bike ride to raise awareness of the Syndrome on specially adapted bikes provided by Oldham Wheels for All 11am until 1.45pm. Then we'll enjoy a fun afternoon together at the Honeywell centre, where the children (and adults) can run around/play on an enclosed 3g pitch & watch dvds on a big screen whilst we all enjoy a BBQ from 2pm until 5pm. 

It will be a great day; hope you can join us!
