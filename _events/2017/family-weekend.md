The 2017 Cri du Chat Syndrome Support Group Family Weekend is being held in Northampton, in May! Join us for a weekend of sharing, learning, meeting up with friends, and laughter!

Our family weekend this year is focused on collaborative discussion and workshops. We want you to share your experiences with other families, and help each other out. After all, you are the experts! We are currently working on the programme and will update this page when we have more news.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How many can sleep in each room?

Because of the way the hotel is set up each room can take two adults, and two children under 12 on a double sofa bed. We also have a few larger rooms available that will fit a cot as well if you are a family with three small children and some interconnecting rooms, in order to facilitate larger families or those with children older than 12, but please do get in [contact](/about/contact)to discuss this before you book.&nbsp;

### What is included in the above rate?

As our family weekend runs from Friday afternoon to Sunday morning your rate will include B&B for the Friday and Saturday night, a buffet dinner on Friday and Saturday night, speakers & workshops, and a trip to a nearby Zoo on the Saturday. A buffet will be provided at the hotel on Saturday for those attending the speakers & workshops and a packed lunch will be provided for those on the trip.&nbsp;

Day Delegates will receive speakers & workshops and a lunch on Saturday only.&nbsp;

### Are cots provided by the hotel?

The hotel will be able to provide some cots, but supply is always limited, so if you have a travel cot you can bring, please do.

### Childcare arrangements

As in previous years we will also be offering a trip on the Saturday which will be to a nearby zoo. We will arrange for a coach to pick up in the morning and drop back in the afternoon and provide pack lunches and entry to the Zoo. If you indicate that you are interested in the trip then we will get in touch once we have processed your booking to discuss care arrangements in order to facilitate this trip but we can either offer an extra bedroom at no charge, if you are able to bring a friend/family member, or we have a small number of carers through a local agency if you would prefer. We offer this option to cater for the preferences of families, after feedback from previous years, and understand that every family is different. If you would prefer to chat before you book please contact me.&nbsp;
