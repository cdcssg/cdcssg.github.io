The 2017 Cri du Chat Syndrome Support Group Family Weekend is being held in Northampton, in May! Join us for a weekend of sharing, learning, meeting up with friends, and laughter!

Our family weekend this year is focused on collaborative discussion and workshops. We want you to share your experiences with other families, and help each other out. After all, you are the experts! We are currently working on the programme and will update this page when we have more news.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How many can sleep in each room?

Each room can take two adults, and two children under 12 on a double sofa bed. We also have a few larger rooms available that will fit a cot as well if you are a family with three small children but please get in contact if you would like to discuss your arrangements.

### Are cots provided by the hotel?

The hotel will be able to provide some cots, but supply is always limited, so if you have a travel cot you can bring, please do.
