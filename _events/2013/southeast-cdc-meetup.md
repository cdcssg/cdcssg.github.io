Come and meet up with other CDC families in the southeast; Sussex, Surrey, Kent, and beyond! 

2 1/2 hours of playtime at Springboard House in Horsham, with soft play, sensory room, and outdoor play equipment for children with special needs (weather permitting). We'll also book an area in a nearby pub for dinner afterwards.
