<p>You can make a one-off or regular donation through JustGiving. It's safe, easy, and we will automatically receive Gift Aid if you're a UK taxpayer.</p>

<p>If you'd prefer not to use JustGiving, you can also make an online donation through <a title="PayPal" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&amp;business=office%40criduchat%2eorg%2euk&amp;lc=GB&amp;item_name=Donation%20to%20the%20Cri%20du%20Chat%20Syndrome%20Support%20Group&amp;no_note=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donate_SM%2egif%3aNonHostedGuest">Paypal</a>.</p>

<h2>Other ways to donate</h2>

<h3>By Cheque</h3>
<p>Please make cheques payable to "Cri du Chat Syndrome Support Group" and post to:</p>
<p>Ray Clarke, Treasurer, 5 Latimer Drive, Laindon, Essex, SS15 4AD</p>

<h3>Payroll Giving</h3>
<p>Make a regular contribution direct from your payslip. It's taken before tax, so a £10 donation would only cost you £8. Visit the <a title="payroll giving" href="https://www.gov.uk/donating-to-charity/donating-straight-from-your-wages-or-pension">gov.uk information page</a> for more details.</p>

<h3>Gift Aid</h3>
<p>If you are a UK taxpayer, we can claim back the tax on your donations through Gift Aid. The scheme means that your gift can increase in value by nearly a third. Visit <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/charities/gift-aid.htm">HMRC's information page</a> for more details.</p>
<p>If you would like us to claim back the tax on your donations then please print out our Gift Aid declaration form, fill it in and send it to us.</p>

<h3>Legacies</h3>
<p>Leaving a gift in your will is simple and cost effective. You can leave a specific gift (such as stocks and shares, property, a coin collection etc), a monetary sum or a portion of your estate. Please help our work in the future and consider leaving a gift in your will. See the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/donating-to-charity/leaving-gifts-to-charity-in-your-will" title="gov.uk charitable giving">gov.uk charitable giving</a> pages for more information.</p>
