We always need to raise money so that we can provide support and advice to families, 
run the annual conference, and so on. If you'd like to help, there are lots of ways 
you can do so:

## [Make a donation](donate.html)

You can either donate directly, or sponsor one of our many brilliant fundraisers.

## [5p for 5p](5p-for-5p.html)

Why not make a "5p for 5p" collection bottle and put it out in your office, school, 
or local pub?

## [Raise money with JustGiving](https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising-page/creation/event-selection?pcid=4f759fb9-a7f4-4673-952d-bacaf8db64e8)

Running a marathon? Jumping out of a plane? You can use JustGiving to raise money for 
us online, and all the money is handled for you. Couldn't be easier!
