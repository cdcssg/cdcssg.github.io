##Internet Shopping 

A classic and easy way to start fundraising for the group. Visit [www.easyfundraising.org.uk](http://www.easyfundraising.org.uk/causes/cdcssg) and click "Sign me up".
Once you have registered any purchase you make, via the site, will result in a small donation back to us. This does not cost you anything and is funded by retail companies signing up to the scheme.
You can check up at any time to see how much you have raised. 

##Cartridge recycling

Cash for Cartridges buy most (but not all) empty ink cartridges used in printers throughout the UK and will pay for your empty ink cartridges to reach their recyling centre.
Many of us work at companies that use printers or have one at home, and this is a great way to raise money easily for the support group. 
Full details of this scheme are available from [their website](http://www.cashforcartridges.co.uk).

##Community and Work Fundraising

There are many ways to raise money in your local community and it is a great way to get involved and help support our work.

So why not....

* Hold a fundraising event in aid of the group. It could be anything from a coffee morning, a tea party, casino or disco night. 
* Get your company to support us. From charity of the year partnerships to one off donation there are many ways we can work together.
* Get fit for the group. Our fundraisers are involved in many sporting events - see our [donate](donate.html) page for examples
