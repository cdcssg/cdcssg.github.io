### EasyFundraising

Visit [our page on EasyFundraising](http://www.easyfundraising.org.uk/causes/cdcssg) and click "Sign me up".
Once you have registered any purchase you make, via the site, will result in a small donation back to us. This does not cost you anything and is funded by retail companies signing up to the scheme.
You can check up at any time to see how much you have raised. 

The easiest way to use EasyFundraising is to install their [Reminder Toolbar](https://new.easyfundraising.org.uk/donation-reminder/toolbar-install/), which pops up a message every time you visit a site where you can raise money. It's easy, and you'll never forget again!

## Cartridge recycling

Cash for Cartridges buy most (but not all) empty ink cartridges used in printers throughout the UK and will pay for your empty ink cartridges to reach their recycling centre.
Many of us work at companies that use printers or have one at home, and this is a great way to raise money easily for the support group. 
Full details of this scheme are available from [their website](http://www.cashforcartridges.co.uk).

## The People's Operator

[The People's Operator](http://www.thepeoplesoperator.com) is a mobile phone operator (using the EE network) that donates 10% of your bill each month to charity. When you sign up, you can choose to make that donation to us by searching for "Cri du Chat". **Note**: we don't endorse the network in any way, or claim that it's a good deal for you. You should *always* do your own research.

## Community and Work Fundraising

There are many ways to raise money in your local community and it is a great way to get involved and help support our work.

* Hold a fundraising event in aid of the group. It could be anything from a coffee morning, a tea party, casino or disco night. Download our [invitation template](/downloads/coffee_morning_invitation.doc) to get started.
* Get your company to support us. From charity of the year partnerships, to one off donations there are many ways we can work together.
* Get fit for the group. Our fundraisers are involved in many sporting events - see our [donate](donate.html) page for examples
