##Cartridge recycling

Cash for Cartridges buy most (but not all) empty ink cartridges used in printers throughout the UK and will pay for your empty ink cartridges to reach their recycling centre.
Many of us work at companies that use printers or have one at home, and this is a great way to raise money easily for the support group. 
Full details of this scheme are available from [their website](http://www.cashforcartridges.co.uk).

##Community and Work Fundraising

There are many ways to raise money in your local community and it is a great way to get involved and help support our work.
