Cri du Chat is sometimes known as "5p-" because of the bit of chromosome that is deleted. Spotting the link, we started a "5p for 5p" fundraising campaign.

If you want to take part, just follow these simple steps:

1. Buy a bottle of wine and drink it! (good start, eh?)
2. Find someone sober and get them to [download, print and cut out our special label](/downloads/5pfor5p.pdf).
3. Write your name and phone number on the back, and your child's name on the front if you want to.
4. Stick the label around the bottle.
5. Put the bottle in your office, school, pub, etc.
6. When it's full, donate the cash using our [JustGiving page](https://www.justgiving.com/5pfor5p).
7. Treat yourself to another bottle of wine and start again!

The clever bit is that only 5p coins will fit the bottle, so it should be easy to get it changed at the bank.

So, what are you waiting for? Get down the off-license immediately!
