title: What is CdC Awareness Week?
author: Lucy Santos

Cri du Chat Awareness Week is to raise awareness of this rare syndrome and to help support families with a child or adult with Cri du Chat syndrome. We have found the best way to do this is through word of mouth and stories from families about their own experience.

In the run up to this week, to be held in May 2013, our families, friends and supporters will be invited to become Ambassadors and take a pledge. The CdC Awareness Week 2013 pledge is a commitment to undertake as many of our simple ideas as possible to spread the word about CdC with most of the activities planned for 5th May 2013. We hope you will join us!
