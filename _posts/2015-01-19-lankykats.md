We are delighted to be one of the [Lankykats](http://www.lankykats.com) chosen charities for 2014 and 2015. 

Formed by Lancastrian musicians Lankykats Rock ‘n Roll Kollective was launched by volunteers in 2011. 

The Cri du Chat Syndrome Support group relies on donations and the fundraising efforts of our supporters and we are so grateful to be one of Lankykat’s beneficiaries.
