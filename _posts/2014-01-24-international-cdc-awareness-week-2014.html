<h2>May 4 - 10, 2014</h2>

<p>The USA's <a href='http://fivepminus.org'>5p- society</a> have launched a new website for <a href='http://www.criduchat.org/'>International Cri du Chat Awareness Week 2014</a>. They've also made a rather nice video to promote it, which you can watch at the bottom of the page.</p>

<p>Why not see if you can raise some awareness this year? You could try to get some <a href='http://metro.co.uk/2013/09/17/lisa-bowden-my-daughter-evie-has-cri-du-chat-syndrome-but-she-still-finds-ways-to-communicate-4027078/'>coverage in a paper</a>, or perhaps call up your local radio station! Maybe hold an event at your child's school, or have a sponsored day at work. However you do it, it all helps raise awareness, and if you can do some <a href='/fundraising/index.html'>fundraising</a> at the same time, so much the better!</p>
