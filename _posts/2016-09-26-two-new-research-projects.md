More scientific research into Cri du Chat Syndrome is always a good thing, to help our families and all those in the future. So, we're excited to tell you about not one but **two** new research projects that need your help!

## ImagineID

First up is [ImagineID](http://www.imagine-id.org/), a study being carried out by the Universities of Cambridge and Cardiff, and University College London. It's focused on development and behaviour in children over 4 with a range of genetic conditions, including Cri du Chat.

The study consists of an online questionnaire and a few online tests, possibly followed up by a face-to-face meeting with the team. It could take 3 hours to complete as it's quite in-depth, but the study also is very large, so should provide some really useful insights.

For more information and to get involved, visit the [ImagineID website](http://www.imagine-id.org/) or download their [information leaflet](/downloads/IMAGINE_ID_Invitation_v1_1_160222.pdf).

## FIND Communication Study

The second study is focused on communication in children under 16, and is being carried out by the Cerebra Centre for Neurodevelopmental Disorders, at the University of Birmingham. It consists of an online questionnaire and a followup phone interview which should only take 45 minutes each.

To get involved, [visit the FIND website](http://www.findresources.co.uk/the-communication-profile-of-cri-du-chat-syndrome) for contact details and more information.

## Thank you!

All the researchers in this area really appreciate your help, and as there as so few families affected by CdC, every single one of you has important information. If you can spare a couple of hours, you could make a real difference to our understanding of CdCS. Thank you all.
