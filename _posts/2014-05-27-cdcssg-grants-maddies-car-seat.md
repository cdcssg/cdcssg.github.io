Back in January of this year, it was decided by our physiotherapist that from a physio point of view Maddie’s baby car seat was no longer good for her posture.

Also being that she is so small she was nowhere near heavy enough for the next size car seat. Our physio and our occupational therapist, decided that a specialist carseat would be the best option all round for Maddie.

Unfortunately this wasn’t something we were in a position to afford at the time – having just moved house and with other expenses. We had hoped that the hopsital’s OT department would fund the seat for us but they were unable to.

Thankfully I was told about the small grant available from the CdCSSG and it became a lifeline. Applying was easy and a decision was made within a week.

To hear that we could transport Maddie around in safety as well as meeting her physio needs was such a relief. We are extremely grateful for CdCSSG UK and their kind support.
