On Sunday 18th January 2015, 11 families from the South East met up in Horsham for a regional gathering of our CDCS friends. It was great to meet lots of new families who  joined us for the first time, and finally meet other kids with Cri du Chat.

We all met up at [Springboard House](http://www.springboardproject.com/) in Horsham, a local play centre that caters especially for children with special needs. The kids were able to jump about in the soft play room, chill in the sensory room, play in the toy room, or run about outside in the garden. Some of us adults even had a hula hooping contest!

Just like last year, Andy Sparkes ran the kitchen like an expert, providing hot drinks and nibbles for anyone whose kids would let them get away!

It's always lovely to see our children playing together and enjoying themselves in a safe environment. It's also a great opportunity for parents to be able to relax around others who understand.

Although a few families had to leave early, most of us went on to a nearby pub for a buffet dinner. The venue delivered plenty of food for everyone, and even included Mr Men balloons and drink bottles for the kids.

Many thanks go to the CDCS support group for funding the event again. It's great to see other meetups happening around the country, and we'd definitely recommend holding one in your area!
