As children with CdCS develop, their needs change. Most of the issues listed below are covered in more detail in the following sections.

## Under 2

Remember, children with CdCS may not have all the problems listed below. However, these are common problems:

* Delayed milestones and failure to thrive
* Muscle weakness (or low muscle tone)
* Poor mobility
* Gastric reflux and vomiting
* Constipation
* Difficulty in feeding
* Heart Problems

## Over 2

As children grow older the following additional problems may become more apparent:

* Speech problems
* Hearing problems
* Vision problems
* Behavioural problems
* Orthopaedic problems
* Emotional difficulties

## Growth Rates

Children with CdCS may grow more slowly than other children. This means that the standard growth charts are not necessarily accurate.

Some growth charts specifically for children with CdCS were produced by an international team of researchers in 2000. You can download their paper and the charts [here](/downloads/growth_charts.pdf).
