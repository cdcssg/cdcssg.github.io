Diagnosis is usually performed within the first few days of birth. For some babies this may be longer because the syndrome may not be initially evident. The syndrome is determined by a combination of symptoms, physical examination by a specialist and genetic testing indicating missing part of chromosome 5.

Symptoms include:
* Cry that is high-pitched and sounds like a cat
* Downward slant to the eyes
* Low birth weight and slow growth
* Low-set or abnormally shaped ears
* Intellectual disability
* Partial webbing or fusing of fingers or toes
* Single line in the palm of the hand
* Skin tags just in front of the ear
* Slow or incomplete development of motor skills
* Small head (microcephaly)
* Small jaw (micrognathia)
* Wide-set eyes

Physical examination may identify the following:
* Inguinal hernia
* Diastasis recti (separation of the muscles in the belly area)
* Low muscle tone
* Epicanthal folds, an extra fold of skin over the inner corner of the eye
* Problems with the folding of the outer ears

Full genetic testing (from a small blood sample) is recommended as it is the only method of obtaining an accurate diagnosis. Parents may also wish to be tested to see if they have the 10-15% chance of being carriers.

###Family advice

If it is a new case then there is no risk to the immediate family and close relations. If a parent is found to be a carrier then further investigations may be warranted of their siblings. Leaflets for counselling, advice for appointments and siblings for these question can be sought from; [http://www.geneticalliance.org.uk/publications_patients.htm](http://www.geneticalliance.org.uk/publications_patients.htm)
