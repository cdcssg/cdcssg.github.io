All children with CdCS will require a range of therapies as they develop. We will explore the most common therapies that your child may require. The list is not exhaustive and all children’s individual needs will differ. Your family doctor (GP) or community paediatrician will usually be the main point of focus and coordinator of therapies. Advice should be sourced from these contacts when first discussing your child’s requirements.

##Physiotherapy

Many children will experience physical difficulties during their development. Physiotherapy can help your child’s physical development including helping them to sit, stand and improve their fine motorskills. There are specialised physiotherapists who can supple orthotics to help with joint and spinal disorders know as Orthotists.

##Occupational Therapy

Occupational therapists work in-conjunction with physiotherapy to develop children’s fine motor movements and activities of daily living. They also will be involved in ensuring that your home has the right adaptations for you and your child. In the unfortunate eventuality that your child requires a wheelchair, OTs will assist you in ensuring that your child has the appropriate chair.

##Speech Therapy

A child with CdCS may experience difficultly in swallowing and speaking. Speech therapists may work with your child from an early age to aid swallowing by providing advice on what is the best method of feeding your child. As your child grows older they may experience problems with their speech, speech therapists will provide guidance on how you can assist your child to communicate. In addition, dribbling is also a common problem for children with CdCS; speech therapists will also provide advice regarding how this can be managed.

##Dietician

Due to the problems of thriving many children with CdCS experience and their difficulty in swallowing a dietician will provide advice on special dietary requirements, for example high calorie drinks.

##Psychologist

Due to the prevalence of behavioural problems in CdCS children many will require psychologically input and advice for their parents. In addition educational psychologists may be involved to assess the best educational placement for your child.

##Audiology

Glue ear is common in CdCS children and therefore children will often undertake tests to assess the quality of their hearing. Many children end up having hearing aids.

##Ophthalmology

Ophthalmology will assess your children’s eyesight as problems are more prevalent in children with CdCS.
