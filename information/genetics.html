<p>
  Cri du Chat Syndrome is caused by the deletion of some genetic material (DNA). The deletion is on
  the short arm of Chromosome 5. This is known as 5p- in medical terms.
</p>

<p>
  The diagrams in the medical section below show the layout of Chromosome 5, and in combination with a genetic
  diagnosis can show which parts of the chromosome are missing.

    also not take them as a guide to how your child will develop. Much about this syndrome is unknown,
    and every child is different.

      These diagrams show which syndrome features have been found to correspond 
      to particular deletions across a number of different studies. As you can see,
      some are contradictory or vague, so these should not be used as a prediction
      tool for how a child will develop.
