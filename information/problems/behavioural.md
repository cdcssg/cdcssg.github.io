Several surveys have discovered an excess of behavioural problems in CdCS children. These include hyperactivity, aggressive and oppositional behaviour as well as sleep problems. What can you do if your child is behaving badly? Well, the first thing to do is to keep a record of what’s happening in the form of a diary. To do this systematically, it helps to have 4 columns entitled “what happened”, “what led up to it”; “what happened as a result” and, usually most importantly “what response to the behaviour did I make”. Surprisingly, by doing this you may easily detect what is happening and by altering your response to the particular behaviour, either stop it or change it for the better.

Clear communication that is concise and said with conviction using words or symbols that the child readily understands can help and focussing on good behaviour with lots of praise; furthermore, actively encourage children to do praiseworthy things such as tidying up their toys, playing nicely with their siblings or friends, etc. An ounce of praise is worth a ton of punishment in these circumstances. Special Needs Teachers, Health Visitors and Child Psychologists are also good sources of sensible advice for families with badly behaved children.
