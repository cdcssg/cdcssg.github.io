## Constipation

As they have weaker muscles, many children with CdCS will suffer from constipation.

There are a range of treatments available, including:

* Suppositories (for small children)
* Lactulose
* Movicol
* Senokot

## Toilet Training

Most children with CdCS will take longer to learn to use the toilet. As your child develops, you may be able to speak to a specialist *continence nurse* to get advice on toilet training.

Once over a certain age, you can get free nappies for your child; speak to your continence nurse to arrange it.
