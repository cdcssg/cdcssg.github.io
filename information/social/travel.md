##Motability Scheme

This is a means of purchasing a brand new car without the worry of servicing, tax, insurance etc. Applications can be processed through accredited dealerships and basically once approved; the car is paid for using your Disabled Living Allowance (higher rate of mobility care). You can make additional contributions but must receive the higher rate of DLA. Motability can be contacted at: [www.motability.co.uk](http://www.motability.co.uk) or 01279 635666.

###Adaptations

Mostly adaptations are not required, though due to poor muscular control, supporting seats may be required. Advice can be sought from your Occupational Therapist.



##National Rail

National Rail needs advance warning if you need any assistance from staff - ideally more than 24 hours' notice. This is particularly important if your journey includes getting on or off a train at an unstaffed station.

Telephone: 0845 7484 950 Textphone: 0845 6050 600

###Mainline trains

On mainline (intercity, suburban and cross-country) trains there is a space designed for wheelchair users to travel in safety and comfort. You must always use this space and should apply your brakes when the vehicle is moving. If you use a powered wheelchair, you should make sure that the power is switched off when travelling.

###Local and regional services

Most trains can accommodate wheelchair users and new trains also have facilities to assist sensory impaired people, for example public information systems that are both visual and audible.

To arrange a train journey in the UK, contact National Rail Enquiries.
