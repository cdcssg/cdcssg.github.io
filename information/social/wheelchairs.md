One of the ways to get a wheelchair is through the National Health Service (NHS) Wheelchair Service. This includes an assessment to make sure your needs are met. Wheelchairs can be manual or powered; there are four different types of powered wheelchair.

##NHS Wheelchair Services

NHS Wheelchair Services are run by local health authorities. They are responsible for allocating funds to the Wheelchair Service and Primary Care Trusts who are responsible for providing the service itself. This sometimes includes contracting the running of the service to an outside company.
