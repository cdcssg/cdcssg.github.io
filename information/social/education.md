A leaflet entitled ‘Statutory assessment—Education’ (leaflet code ES26) from Early Support explains the process of requesting an assessment for your child and provides examples of letters to help you. It also describes what a Statement of Special Educational Needs is. This can be obtained from the [Early Support website](http://www.earlysupport.org.uk) or by phoning 0845 602 2260.
Mostly preschools and nursery can accommodate children with CdCS with key worker help, then special primary schools have been found to benefit almost all; very few have been able to go mainstream. For your rights see [direct.gov.uk](http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/DisabledPeople/index.htm).

##Special Educational Needs - Identification and Assessment

Early identification, assessment and provision for any child who may have Special Educational Needs (SEN) is crucial. The SEN Code of Practice, to which schools, early education settings, (Local Educational Authority) LEA's and others must by law have regard, promotes a common approach to identifying, assessing and providing for all children’s special educational needs.

##School Transport

Transport to schools will normally be provided by your local authority and they will do a risk assessment for their seating requirements if necessary.

##The National Parent Partnership

The National Parent Partnership Service offers impartial advice, information and support to parents/carers of children and young people with special educational needs. They are very helpful and can often save you hours of worry by simply knowing who you need to contact for what. They will also liaise on your behalf with schools/LEA. Simply visit the [Parent Partnership website](http://www.parentpartnership.org.uk) to find your local contact.
