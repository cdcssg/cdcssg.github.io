If you have impairment or a health condition that makes living alone difficult, making some adaptations to your home or getting extra support may help you to live in your own home.

###Living in your own home

You have the right for your needs to be assessed by the social services department of your local council. Following a health and social care assessment, an occupational therapist may recommend types of equipment and ideas about adapting your home. You may be entitled to financial help, such as a Disabled Facilities Grant, to pay for adaptations or improvements to your home. Please see [www.direct.gov.uk](www.direct.gov.uk) for more information.

###Independent Living

There are difficult choices to be made as whether the CDCs stay with their family’s or be a ‘looked after person’ and then go into independent living or sheltered accommodation; at each stage a multi-agency team [health, social services, educational] will assess the needs of all and come to a decision as what is the best compromise for CdCs, families and carers.
