  Cri du Chat Syndrome is caused by a missing section of the short arm of the fifth
  chromosome (5p-, in medical terms). 
</p>

<p>  
  Around 85% of the time it is random, but in 
  around 15% of cases it's inherited from a parent who may <em>have</em> the missing part,
  but not in the right place. This is called a <em>translocation</em>. That's why, as a parent
  of a CdCS child, it's sensible to get your own chromosomes tested if you are considering
  having more children.
