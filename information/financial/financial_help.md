CAB (Citizens Advice Bureau) can help with advice locally about benefits and can be found through your phone directory.

##Family Fund

The Family Fund helps families with severely disabled children to have choices and the opportunity to enjoy ordinary life â€“ giving grants for things that make life easier for the disabled child and their family, such as washing machines, driving lessons, hospital visiting costs, computers and holidays. They will consider funding anything connected to bringing up a disabled child.

##Disability Living Allowance

This is a benefit provided to those under the age of 65 with a long term health problem which affects your everyday activities. It is not means tested and not affected by any other benefits. It is split into mobility and personal care and each is assessed separately with a different rate of allowance for each. There is a lengthy form to complete and you may require assistance to complete. The amount awarded can be up to several hundred pounds paid four weekly. It is tax free.

##Motability Scheme

This is a means of purchasing a brand new car without the worry of servicing, tax, insurance etc. Applications can be processed through accredited dealerships and basically once approved; the car is paid for using your Disabled Living Allowance (higher rate of mobility care). You can make additional contributions but must receive the higher rate of DLA. Motability can be contacted at: [www.motability.co.uk](http://www.motability.co.uk) or 01279 635666.

###Adaptations

Mostly adaptations are not required, though due to poor muscular control, supporting seats may be required. Advice can be sought from your Occupational Therapist.

##Direct Payments

Direct payments are local council payments for people who have been assessed as needing help from social services, and who would like to arrange and pay for their own care and support services instead of receiving them directly from the local council. A person must be able to give their consent to receiving direct payments and be able to manage them even if they need help to do this on a day-to-day basis. The website www.direct.gov.uk provides further information.
