You may not need specialist insurance, but if you do, it can be difficult to find adequate and affordable insurance policies with a pre-existing condition. 

The [Banner Group](http://www.bannergroup.com) offer travel insurance for people with pre-existing conditions, though they cannot guarantee cover for everyone or for all conditions. There may be others available, and this should not be taken as a recommendation.
