## 27-29 June 2014, Holiday Inn, Chessington World of Adventures Resort

We're excited to announce that this years' family weekend will be held at Chessington World of Adventures, just south of London.

We will confirm the speakers and workshops shortly.

## Prices

£75 per person (over 12, up to two rooms)

Includes: B&B at the Holiday Inn, Chessington on Friday and Saturday night, Friday night buffet, Day delegate rate for adults, trip (including carers) for the children, lunch and refreshments during Saturday.

Each room sleeps two adults and two children up to 12.

As a group we will be subsidising the entire weekend by £15,000 and we will try to remain within this budget. Therefore each family will be able to apply for a maximum of two rooms at this subsidised rate of £75 per adult. If you need more than two rooms, see the extended families pricing below.

#### Extended Families

£129 for Friday night and £159 for Saturday night (per room)

We do hope that extended families will still be able to attend but we cannot subsidise their rooms (although they will still of course be able to attend the Friday dinner, conference portion of the weekend and lunch on Saturday free of cost).

### Day Delegates

Day delegate rates are also available but are limited due to constraints of space.
