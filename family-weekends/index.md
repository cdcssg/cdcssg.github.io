Our support group has been holding family weekends since the early 1990s and is the only event in the UK that is held specifically for the families, carers and professionals interested in Cri du Chat Syndrome.

We hope you will consider joining us at our next family weekend and, if this is you first time, look forward to meeitng you. We know that it can be hard to come to your first family weekend so we can arrange for a committee member to get in touch prior to the confernce to introduce themselves and their family.
