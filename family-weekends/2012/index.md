Our Annual Family Weekend in 2012 was held in Sheffield. We were delighted to welcome around 27 families from all over the UK (and some further afield, including one from South Africa).
 
We had a full programme of events on the Saturday and an excellent night of socialising on the Friday night. The children were treated to a day at the Yorkshire Wildlife Park in the capable hands of Saga who provided one to one care.
