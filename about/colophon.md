We made this site using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), and we used Twitter's 
[Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap) CSS framework for the
styling.

The font is Transport New Light, by [K-Type](http://www.k-type.com/). 
We also used [FontAwesome](http://fontawesome.github.io) for the icons.

Our cookie notification uses [CookieCuttr](http://cookiecuttr.com/).

We try to stick to the [Gov.uk style guide](https://www.gov.uk/designprinciples/styleguide) 
as much as we can.

You can get all the code for the site and style from 
[Github](http://github.com/cdcssg); help us make it better!
