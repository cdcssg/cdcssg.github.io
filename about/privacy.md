## Website Data

We use browser cookies to track our visitors, so that we can find out what content
people are interested in, and where we should focus our efforts. 

We do this using Google Analytics, so this information is sent to Google's systems. 
We don't get any personal information from this, though the network address 
of your computer is collected as part of the process.

If you do not want to be tracked in this way, you can click the 'Decline' button
when asked if you want to accept cookies.

The content of any forms you submit will be stored in our systems, including any
contact information you include, though we won't use it for any other purpose.
