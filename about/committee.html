      "Hi, I live and work in Oxford as a public health specialist. I have a boy,
      Matias, with Cri du Chat Syndrome. He is wonderfully happy but lazy. He
      attends the local special needs school, Mabel Prichard, where I am the
      vice-chair of the governing body. It is a wonderful school, full of life and
      learning. I really enjoy spending time in the school interacting with the
      teachers and children. As such I would recommend to all to become involved
      with their child's school. On the committee of the charity I am
      somewhat of an advisor on all things scientific. I try to
      ensure that what we say and recommend is recognised as effective and is based
      upon good evidence."

      "Hello, I am Jamie. I live in Liverpool with my wife Amy, son Harry and daughter Poppy. I was born in Suffolk but University brought me to the North West.
Amy is a G.P. and I am a part time university student studying Theology and Pastoral studies, I work for my Church the rest of the week. Prior to that I was a Secondary school PE Teacher for 10 years.
Amy and I found out that Poppy had CdC shortly after our 20 week scan which gave us lots of time to think, plan, cry and cry some more before she arrived on 5th Oct 2012.
I joined the Committee in 2013 after attending the Annual Conference and seeing the great benefits of having a CdC family support network.
I want to help and support other families, particularly those who are just starting out on their journey with CdC."

      "I am the mother to Enid aged 4 who has CdC, and three other daughters aged 3, 2 and 1. I work as a freelance marketing consultant which gives me the flexibility to work around the girls. I officially joined the committee in 2014 after a few 'taster sessions', and I hope I can add value to the work of the committee, particularly on the marketing and web content side. "
