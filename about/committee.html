      "Hi, I live and work in Oxford as a public health specialist. I have a boy, 
      Matias, with Cri du Chat Syndrome. He is wonderfully happy but lazy. He 
      attends the local special needs school, Mabel Prichard, where I am the 
      vice-chair of the governing body. It is a wonderful school, full of life and 
      learning. I really enjoy spending time in the school interacting with the 
      teachers and children. As such I would recommend to all to become involved 
      with their child's school. On the committee of the charity I am 
      somewhat of an advisor on all things scientific. I try to 
      ensure that what we say and recommend is recognised as effective and is based
      upon good evidence."
