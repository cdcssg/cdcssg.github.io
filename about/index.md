The Cri du Chat Syndrome Support Group was founded in the mid 1980s by Ann Wilson, a parent of a child with CdC Syndrome, after discovering there was no support group specifically for this syndrome.

A Steering Group was formed in 1991 and the group became a registered charity in 1993. The support group is formed by families and relatives of those with CdC Syndrome as well as research members who have expressed an interest in this condition.

The group is open to anyone who has an interest of need.

The group supplies information, advice and support through its [Clinical Advisory Group](/information/cag.html), formed by members of the [committee](/about/committee.html) and outside professionals.

We receive no government funding and are funded by memberships, individual and corporate donations as well as fundraising activities.
