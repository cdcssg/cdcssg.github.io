The Cri du Chat Syndrome Support Group was founded in the mid 1980s by Ann Wilson, a 
parent of a child with [Cri du Chat Syndrome](/information/index.html), after discovering there was no support 
group specifically for this syndrome.

A steering group was formed in 1991, and the group became a registered charity 
([#1044942](http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/search-for-a-charity/?txt=1044942)) in 1993. 

The support group is made up of families and relatives of those with CdCS, as 
well as research members who have expressed an interest in this condition. However,
the group is open to *anyone* with an interest or need, whether in the UK or
abroad.

The group provides information, advice and support through its 
[Clinical Advisory Group](/information/cag.html), formed by members of the 
[committee](/about/committee.html) and outside professionals.

We receive no government funding and are funded by memberships, individual and 
corporate donations as well as fundraising activities.
